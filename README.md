# SCRiPTeX

Brock University, COSC 4F00 - Software Development, Final Capstone Project

SCRiPTeX was an attempt at demonstrating a real world application of machine learning. The software was intended to be able to segment handwritten symbols, recognize them as mathematical notation and symbols, and assemble a typeset document.

Documentation for the software throughout it's development, as well as what serves as the final documentation for the software can be found in the root of this repository.
